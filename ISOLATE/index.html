      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>My name is Jorin Stamatiou (s3872832) and I can be contacted directly at s3872832@student.rmit.edu.au. My nationality is Australian born Greek and I currently work in an accounting firm in Perth, I have a Cert IV in Real Estate and in Property Management. I enjoy exercise, love dogs and am very outgoing socially. I have a passion for computing and IT and one day would love to play a serious role in the industry</p>

      <p id="u116-2">My Interest in IT:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>My interest in IT runs broad and deep, from engaging in the creative aspects such as game design all the way to things such as network architecture and coding. For me it all started when we first purchased computer when I was very young, I remember my dad showing me the basics and before long my computing knowledge surpassed his before I was even 10. I was mesmerized as to how much could be done with a mere keyboard and mouse and from there my passion only deepened to where it is today. Experience wise I did Applied Information Technology 3AB during my schooling at Hale School and found it most engaging and rewarding. Additionally, I manage most of the IT procedures at the accounting firm I work at.</p>
      <p>Initially when deciding what university to attend my first choice was something local because I live in Perth, however when sifting through options on Open University, I came across RMIT. I decided to do some research into the university and found that a general consensus was that it was a very forward-thinking university which was a big deal for me. Additionally, after making the decision to study fully online, the location of RMIT was no longer a contributing factor and eventually became my first preference.</p>
      <p>First and foremost, with my studies I expect to broaden my knowledge in the fields I’m passionate in, everything else is a bonus. I expect to learn about the true fastness of what is IT as well as delving into more intensive subjects such as C++ as well as Game Design, Artificial Intelligence, Cyber Security and the likes. I have always found both Artificial Intelligence and Cyber Security both interesting yet quite rarely talked about in comparison to how relevant they really are in this day and age so to address these in my studies will be very engaging for me.</p>

     <p>The position mentioned is a senior development level for a emerging single player game for one of Activision’s sister company, Infinity Ward. This position is very appealing to me personally because I have a passion for practical development in graphics and graphic engines. The practicality of building a single player map per se and seeing it come to life in the real time renders appeals to me greatly because a sense of satisfaction and progress is seen in real time.</p>

     <p id="u138-2">Required Skills:</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>The skills required for this role range widely, from graphic design and texture modelling to fluency in an engine builder such as Unity Engine or for this role specifically IW ENGINE 8 (Infinity Ward Engine 8.0). Additionally, a high level of experience being in a team environment and working closely with peers with varying opinions will be important. Seeing as it is a Senior Role, a wide management skillset and leadership skills are imperative in order to function and direct a development team in the right direction effectively and efficiently.</p>

     <p id="u147-2">My Current Skills:</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>Experience-wise I am not completely unfamiliar to the construction of single player games, in the past I’ve had a lot of experience in building SWEP’s (Scripted Weapons) for games such as Counter Strike: Source as well as Garry’s Mod as well as Scripted NPC’s (Non-Playable Characters) for Garry’s Mod and Left for Dead 2. Additionally, I’ve also had an extended history with the level designer Valve Hammer Editor for creating and stress testing maps for Counter Strike: Source. I also have good leadership and communication skills so interacting with the various art design teams mentioned in the job description will not be an unfamiliar interaction for me. Despite this prior experience I know there is a plethora of knowledge I must acquire in order to excel in a job opportunity such as this one.</p>

     <p id="u153-2">How I will acquire the required skills:</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>In order to obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for a demanding position such as this I intend to complete my Degree in IT and either pursue graphic design or coding as majors. Keeping my qualifications broad allows me to hone in at a later date when it comes to workshops and additional recommended qualifications Activision they might require for this role. Another thing that would be important to have experience in would be IW 7.0 and IW 8.0 (Infinity Ward Engine 7.0 and 8.0 respectively), experience in familiarising myself in this engine would be crucial in order to actively make a contribution to the project itself and fulfil the job requirements.</p>

     <p id="u201-2">What these results mean for me:</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>For me these tests display my operational flexibility, I feel I am able to excel to a degree in any position/role I am given in a group or team environment, both the Honey and Mumford as well as the Learning Styles Quiz reciprocate this. However, I do feel, as displayed in the Myers-Briggs Test that as a protagonist I do very well taking charge. I have the advantage of being able to tackle the content as well as taking charge and delegating workloads. I think this is advantageous because I would not just be a dictator, rather a negotiator who would fairly delegate.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p id="u201-8">How i think these results will influence my behavior in a team:</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>I feel like these results may influence my behaviour to lean more towards the authoritative approach, not necessarily to boss people around, more so to ensure that they are performing at the correct pace and that everyone is confident in what they are doing so we maintain a standard. They also display my ability to understand the potential dilemmas that may arise (shown in my assertive behaviour trait in the Myers-Briggs Test). I feel that I will develop a welcoming personal relationship with the people I work with rather than maintain a distance, this, I believe will be quite encouraged.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p id="u201-14">How I should take this into account when forming a team:</p>
     <p id="u201-15">&nbsp;</p>
     <p>When forming a team I think its important to maintain a high level of enthusiasm but also make my peers aware that these are in fact my work methods, I would have to explain that I’m very effective when I take charge however would like them to know that when I say in charge I mean will provide recurring feedback rather than tell them what to do. I will have to make it abundantly clear that my mission is not to be in control, rather to establish solid roles that everyone in aware of (e.g. I think it would be good if I do this part and you do that part if you’re okay with that).</p>

      <p id="u207-2">My Project:</p>
      <p id="u207-3">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u207-5">Overview:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The project will be an application that allows convention organisers to provide a plethora of information to potential patrons including a convention map, pre-purchasable tickets, useful information about certain booths as well as other additional information individuals may find useful for attending a convention. This concept is scalable to other large-scale events such as festivals and other large public gatherings with little to no modification to the original design. Revenue will be generated in two methods, either a completely free plan that will be powered by distributed sponsored contend throughout the event information or a plan that contains no sponsored content or advertisements however the event managers will pay a lump figure and a small percentage of all ticket sales though the app will be charged to them.</p>
      <p id="u207-9">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u207-11">Motivation:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The project will be interesting because usually every exhibition, festival and other large-scale convention typically develops their own mid-tier applications that merely suffice rather than go above and beyond. This is reasonable due to the fact that the application becomes redundant after the event has come and gone, however this application differs because it will instead host the events on the platform allowing it feasible to constantly improve and develop new strategies to make it both more functional to the end user as well as aesthetically pleasing. According to Statista, the current B2B events worldwide revenue surpasses US $30 Billion, however the backend development side of B2B communication and interaction when it comes to mobile applications is heavily lacking. Being an application the initial establishment expenses make up the bulk cost and further development costs are minimal when you take into consideration that the corporations that use it will be providing their own logos, information, graphics and other assets that would typically populate the application. Cost of operation and maintenance would be minimal compared to profits.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u207-17">Description:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The application will contain an ‘Explore” tab that allows the end user to either browse for conventions or events that they may be interested in or enter the Convention ID which will take them directly to the convention they were looking for. Once the user has accessed their desired event, they have the ability to ‘Check In’, this will allow them greater access on the event page including a convention map, POI’s (Positions of Interest) as well as notifying the event organiser that this individual is either interested in the event or has already purchased a ticket. If a user is registered for the event the event planners can relay coupon codes, discount vouchers and other promotional material via QR codes directly into an “Event Coupons” section on the application rather than sending them via email to individuals thus greatly increasing the realistic exposure of said coupons. The application will also have the option to enable push notifications to the user’s device with examples such as: “Product XYZ Mini-Seminar starting in 10 minutes at Booth 13, Tap on this notification to learn more!” Drastically increasing the likelihood of individuals actually attending the sections of seminars they’re actually interested in and overall increasing the turnout for seminars. This functionality will directly apply to other forms of events such as festivals in the likes of “You favorited Frank Ocean, he is performing at the Main Stage in 25 minutes!”.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Event organisers and seminar holders will also have a greater level of backend access in order to relay information in real time to attendees, an example of this would be in the SYNC tab of the application per say where a seminar holder could say “if you’ve heart reacted this mini seminar on technology of the future at booth 15, you’ll soon see I’ve added some good YouTube links in the SYNC tab that you’ll be able to look over in your own time, additionally I’ve left a coupon code for these products if you’re interested in buying any from the conventions store on your way out.”</p>
      <p>The application will also have a My Contacts Page, that is similar to the SYNC page in there it will allow the relay of information however will differ as it is designed for more involved one on one communication between individuals that attend the conventions, it will allow for the embedding of related contact information such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram and the likes in order to allow attendees to get on a more personal level with fellow convention attendees and organisers/seminar hosts alike. This will allow one to one direct messaging, file sharing (word docs, PDF’s, Images and other small format files) as well as a ranking system where they will be able to review the presenter from one to five stars depending on their performance and leave reviews and feedback, the star rating information will be collated and sent to the event organisers however the feedback will only go to the individual themselves in order to learn what they did well with and what they can improve on.</p>
      <p>Once an event has concluded, app users are still able to access information on the event in the Past Events tab, it will maintain most of the core information that was available during the convention however time sensitive information such as “Event Map” will be removed for obvious reasons.</p>
      <p id="u207-28">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u207-30">Required Software and Hardware:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The tools and technologies required for this application vary. For initial development and stress testing, Adobe Dreamweaver and Apple Xcode are important to both develop the initial application itself as well as testing its compatibility with mobile devices. For iOS devices Xcode will allow the signing permission and to publish the APK (Android application) build Dreamweaver will be applicable. Initial hardware requirements are low to host an application like this as it requires minimal dataflow therefor does not require on-site physical hosting hardware infrastructures, many low cost or even free options are applicable for content hosting such as Microsoft Azure or AWS (Amazon Web Services).</p>
      <p id="u207-34">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u207-36">Required Skills:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Required skills for a project like this greatly depend on the distribution. For example, for the deployment of the Android based application would require expertise in Kotlin or Java Coding languages as they are the preferred and supported coding languages for Android. However, on the other end, iOS applications are quite flexible in their required coding language as long as they are languages that Xcode will support and sign. Development does not consist of many hardware requirements other than a computer capable of rendering WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) from raw code. These skills are widespread nowadays as everyone is gearing towards application development for their business endeavours.</p>
      <p id="u207-40">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u207-42">Project Outcome:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Should the project be successful the outcome induces a new standard for high efficiency and quality information distribution. To elaborate, conventions, seminars and other large-scale business or entertainment events will all benefit from this project. The original problem will be solved by cutting costs dramatically for event planners because they will no longer need to tank the expenses of app development and building for an application that will be relevant for a very short amount of time. Increasing overall quality and decreasing the content production duration. The impact of the development of this application would be a transition in the way the public is able to receive communications and relevant information for wide scale professional and entertainment events, both event attendee and organiser satisfaction, in turn, will increase greatly.</p>
